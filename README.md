# Structure of the Repo

Each directory corresponds to one of the tasks, except the `.github/workflow` one which is related to Task 2.

Inside the 3 main directories we will find the following:
- `README.md` that explains the process regarding solving the task with commands ran and outputs and the reasoning. If errors or difficulties were encountered, these are also mentioned and also how I got past them
- `Screenshots` folder which shows screenshots of the commands and outputs
- scripts that were used to solve the tasks
